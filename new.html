          <br>On this special Rose Day, I want you to know that you are the most beautiful part of my life. Just like a rose, you bring color, fragrance, and joy to my world. Every petal reminds me of your kindness, every thorn of your strength. <br>

          <br>If pink and white roses could think, I bet they'd be jealous of you, The pink ones would admire how effortlessly you make the world sweeter, and the white ones would wonder how you manage to be so pure and soft yet so strong. If they had hearts, they’d skip a beat every time you smiled. And if they could walk, they’d probably follow you around, just to be close to something as beautiful as you 🌸💕<br>
          
          <br>Thank you for filling my life with love, laughter, and endless happiness. I appreciate every small to big moment with you, You are the most fragrant rose in my life.<br>
          
          Happy Rose Day, pupu baby :) 🌹❤️
